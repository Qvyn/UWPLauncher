UWPLauncher



A simple, unified launcher for UWP (Microsoft Store/Game Pass) games, Steam games, and regular EXE games — all in one place.



⭐ What This App Does



Launch UWP games easily (Microsoft Store + Game Pass)



Sync and launch Steam games



Add your own EXE games (GOG, custom folders, etc.)



Optional performance settings (CPU affinity, high priority)



Stores your Steam API key encrypted, not in plain text



🟩 Why UWPHook Is Needed



UWP games cannot be launched directly by their .exe.



UWPHook provides the necessary internal AUMID launch info that Windows requires for UWP titles.



Without UWPHook:



UWP/Game Pass games won’t launch



Steam and EXE games still work fine



The launcher will ask for your UWPHook.exe the first time.



🎮 Steam Setup (Optional)



To sync your Steam library:



Open Settings → Sync Steam Library



Enter your SteamID64 and Steam Web API Key



Your API key is stored encrypted and cannot be read from the file



Steam games always launch through Steam — never through UWPHook.



📦 Adding EXE Games



You can also add normal .exe games from anywhere.

These launch normally and do not require UWPHook.
